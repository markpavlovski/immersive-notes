## Tools

### Homebrew

* Specific to Mac
* brew --version
* brew update
* brew install

### Node

* node -v


### Git

* git --version


### Killing apps:

* Ctrl - C: throws error
* Ctrl - D: goes to end document

### Enviromnmental Variable

* printenv
* env

* which env - shows you wwhere a certain command lives

* setting an environmental var: export VARIABLE=123
  * This will set it up for the current session
  * to set it up for every time, we can put it in bash_profile



### $PATH

* usr/local/bin - user installed (maybe brew?)
* usr/bin - system


### resources

* https://github.com/agarrharr/awesome-cli-apps
  * A lot of good


### terminal commands

* using | will take output from the first command and stick it into second.
* printenv > envs.txt will write the output into a text file
* echo "END OF FILE"  >> classmates.txt appends text to bottom of the file


### using grep

1. grep "by Dan Brown" books.txt
2. sort books.txt >> sorted_books.txt
3. sort books.txt | grep "by George Orwell" >> books_by_george_orwell.txt

4. Bonus:

We need to take a list of books, get the list of authors, and write unique sorted list to a file.

```

grep -o 'by .*' books.txt |  grep -o '[A-Z].*' | sort -u > authors.txt

```

Define pattern one letter at a time, the * sign is used to repeat the previous pattern.

### Solutions to Command Line Mystery:

1. Find all people who have all 4 memberships:
```
grep -f AAA Museum_of_Bash_History | grep -f Delta_SkyMiles | grep -f Terminal_City_Library > ../my_solution/SUSPECTS
```
2. Find All male suspects:
```
grep -f my_solution/SUSPECTS people | grep "M\t" | grep -o "[A-Z].*[a-z].[A-Z].*[a-z]\t" > my_solution/MALE-SUSPECTS
```
3. Find all Annabels
```
grep "Annabel" ../people > ANNABEL
```
4. Find interviews that mentioned cars
```
grep " car " interview/*
```

5. Identify drivers of the car that matches the descriptions given by Annabel.
```
grep -A 5 "L337.*9.*" vehicles |
grep -B 2 -A 3 "Color: Blue" |
grep -B 4 -A 1 "Height: 6.*" |
grep "Make: Honda" -B 1 -A 4 |
grep -o "wner:.*" | grep -o "[A-Z].*" |
grep -f my_solution/SUSPECTS >
my_solution/FINAL-SUSPECTS
```

6. And finally we get the likely offender, Jeremy Bowers:

```
grep -f my_solution/FINAL-SUSPECTS my_solution/MALE-SUSPECTS
```



#### And finally we get the likely offender, __Jeremy Bowers__!
